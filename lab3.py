#Scan the list l line by line and add 1 to the counter if the country is the one looked for


#Format and print the result


#Ask the user for the population looked for. Use a loop and a try except to validate the input as a valid integer


#Store the population values into a list called l1 (see line 6)


#Initialize a list lstOfRecords to an empty list


#Scan the list l1, if the population is larger than the population looked for, add the list index to lstOfRecords


#Print the list lstOfRecords


#Bonus: Print the name of the cities whose index is in lstOfRecords
